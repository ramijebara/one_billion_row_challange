# one_billion_row_challenge
This is a basic implementation of the one billion row challenge in Rust.

## Single threaded implementation
- Uses less than 5MB of RAM
- Runs in under 90 seconds on an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U laptop

## Multi threaded implementation
- Used around 15GB of RAM
- Runs in under 30 seconds on an 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U laptop

I used release binaries for testing.
